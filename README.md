## Description
  “Non-fungible” means that it’s unique and can’t be replaced with something else. For example, a bitcoin is fungible — trade one for another bitcoin, and you’ll have exactly the same thing. A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different card, you’d have something completely different. 

  In this project, we created an "Instagram" for collectable NFT's

### User Case

AS AN interested collector of NFT’s  
I WANT to see posted NFT’s   
I WANT to comment on other users NFT’s  
I WANT to show my NFT collection
